# PHP project created using MySql - "projectPHP_Mysql" folder
Here I saved my PHP project, realized during my Backend Development course, using PHP programming language and MySQL Database Service, and HeidiSQL to manage data and database structures.
Features: 
Login, Logout, user register (username, password), change password, add post and contact us form.  

# PHP project - "projectPHP" folder
In this folder, I saved my project made in PHP, using a database made by me, first with a csv file and then with a .json file.
